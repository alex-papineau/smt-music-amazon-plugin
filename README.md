# Amazon SMT Music Companion

A Firefox Extension that plays music from a selection of black market/shopping related tracks from ATLUS' various games (SMT 4, SMT 3, P1 and P3 so far) while browsing Amazon. Complete with a popup UI to control the music.

*"Make sure you bring more Macca next time."*

## Installation -- Firefox (wip to no longer use temporary add-on)

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`.
3. Click **This Firefox** in the top left.
4. Click **Load Temporary Add-on** and select the `manifest.json` file in the root directory of this project.
5. **Visit Amazon.** The song should play automatically. Click the extension icon in the toolbar to open the controls.

## How it works

The extension uses a background script to monitor your active tabs for Amazon URLs. When an Amazon page is detected, it triggers audio playback of tracks hosted via GitHub Pages to ensure a lightweight installation. The popup interface communicates with the background script using the WebExtension API to allow users to switch between different SMT shop themes, adjust volume, and toggle playback.
